# hello-world
Let's pick back up this hobby with something simple.


So my name is Christopher, a teenager who after high school mainly focused on programming classes and college then game development and uni. I may have packed that in because of some personal issues but I'm hoping to get back into it with a few projects. This is a space that can either become a sign that I'm a failure or even more better a progression proof of developing my programing knowledge and skills.

Looking forward to seeing what I can remember and learn!
